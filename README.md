# FamilyCluST

This repository contains the implementation for the paper **"Improving Multilingual Sign Language Translation with Automatically Clustered Language Family Information"**. The paper has been accepted to **COLING 2025**.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the use of automatically clustered language family information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of multilingual sign language translation. The method leverages unsupervised learning techniques to group related sign languages based on linguistic features, which are then used to improve translation performance across multiple sign languages.

## Contribution

- We are the first to integrate language feature distributions within the MSLT (Multilingual Sign Language Translation) framework to explore the underlying structure of sign language families. We provide a detailed comparison and analysis of our proposed family clustering method alongside the insights from sign language linguists.
- To highlight the impact of sign language families on MSLT model performance, we conduct experiments on the SP-10 dataset in a many-to-one translation context. By varying the number of families, we achieve an optimal balance between translation accuracy and resource efficiency.
- Through ablation studies and a series of comparative experiments, we demonstrate that accurate family clustering plays a crucial role in improving the translation accuracy of multilingual sign language translation systems.

## Note

More detailed instructions on how to run the program, including setup, configuration, and usage, will be updated in the near future. Please stay tuned for further updates.
